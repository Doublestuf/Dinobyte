# Dinobyte
A top-down 2d survival rougelite (a lot of words ik) inspired by Ark Survival Evolved and Rust.

the player collects wood and stone to make tools and build a base while trying to stay safe from dinosaurs roaming at night
the goal is to stay alive as long as possible
The player will use chat commands to craft items (i just don't want to do ui so this is my solution lol)

Also yes the name is epik for the reasons below:
1. The game has dinosaurs and the title includes "Dino"
2. There are 8 bits in a byte, and if the game has an 8-bit artstyle in the future, having "byte" in the title could be quite clever
3. "byte" is also quite similar to the world "bite", as in being bitten by a dinosaur, which is likely to happen while playing the game

Game loop:
    Collect resources
    Build base
    Craft tools and armor
    Fight boss dino
    Repeat until end boss
