# Dinobyte
A top-down 2d survival game inspired by ark survival evolved with a gameplay loop like Terraria.

Also yes the name is epik for the reasons below:
1. The game has dinosaurs and the title includes "Dino"
2. There are 8 bits in a byte, and if the game has an 8-bit artstyle in the future, having "byte" in the title could be quite clever
3. "byte" is also quite similar to the world "bite", as in being bitten by a dinosaur, which is likely to happen while playing the game

Game loop:
    Collect resources
    Build base
    Craft tools and armor
    Fight boss dino
    Unlock new area
    Repeat until boss dino is complete

Unique mechanic - Bullet hell dino boss fights, player must dodge and capture dino to unlock as a pet (may change in the future)

(Should have replay value for speedrunners)
