# Dinobyte
A top-down 2d survival game inspired by ark survival evolved with a gameplay loop like Terraria.

Also yes the name is epik for the reasons below:
1. The game has dinosaurs and the title includes "Dino"
2. There are 8 bits in a byte, and if the game has an 8-bit artstyle in the future, having "byte" in the title could be quite clever
3. "byte" is also quite similar to the world "bite", as in being bitten by a dinosaur, which is likely to happen while playing the game

Game loop:
Explore to find resources and dinosaurs to tame
Craft tools and armor to get stronger
Fight bosses with weapons and tamed dinosaurs
Unlock new areas
Repeat until last boss dino
